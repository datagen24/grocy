// A stand-in for InfluxDB, for the suite and for local probing.
//
//   php -S 127.0.0.1:<port> .devtools/mqtt/influx-standin.php
//
// It accepts POST /api/v2/write, appends the request to the file named by
// VICTUAL_STANDIN_LOG, and answers 204 the way the real server does.
//
// Three ways to make it fail, all so that a probe can exercise the failure path without
// needing an unroutable address and its multi-second timeout:
//
//   VICTUAL_STANDIN_REJECT=1        answer 500 to everything
//   VICTUAL_STANDIN_FAIL_AFTER=N    answer 204 to the first N writes and 500 after that,
//                                   which is how the drain loop's "stop at the first
//                                   failure" behaviour gets tested mid-backlog
//   VICTUAL_STANDIN_CONTROL=<path>  read the mode from that file on every request, so a
//                                   test can flip a running server between rejecting and
//                                   accepting without restarting it. The file holds
//                                   "reject", "accept", "fail-after:N", "redirect" or
//                                   "ok-with-body"; it wins over the variables above, and a
//                                   missing file means accept.
//
// The last two modes exist for one defect. A write is only delivered when the *write
// endpoint* acknowledged it, and two shapes used to pass for an acknowledgement:
//
//   redirect       302 to /login, which is what an expired session or an SSO portal in front
//                  of InfluxDB answers with. Guzzle follows redirects by default and does not
//                  raise for a 3xx it cannot follow, so both a bare 302 and a 302 followed to
//                  a 200 login page came back as success.
//   ok-with-body   200 with an HTML page, which is what a proxy that answers everything with
//                  its own page looks like. InfluxDB's write API answers 204 with no body.
//
// GET /login always answers a 200 login page, whatever the mode - so a probe can assert not
// only that the write failed but that /login was never requested at all, which is what proves
// the redirect was refused rather than followed.
//
// The counts come from the log file rather than from memory: the built-in server runs the
// router script afresh per request, so there is nowhere else to keep them.
//
// PHP's own built-in server rather than node, so the suite phase that uses this has no
// dependency beyond the PHP the rest of the suite already needs - a probe that only runs
// where somebody installed node is a probe CI skips.
