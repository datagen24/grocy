// Proves the publication lock serialises what it is supposed to.

//   VICTUAL_DATAPATH=... php .devtools/mqtt/lock-check.php          run the probe
//   VICTUAL_DATAPATH=... php .devtools/mqtt/lock-check.php --hold N hold the lock N seconds
//
// The race the lock closes leaves nothing in a log. Request A assembles the snapshot,
// request B commits a later change and publishes it, then A publishes what it read earlier -
// and since retained topics carry no version and no ordering, the broker keeps A's stale
// state until the next write. On a pod that sleeps for days that is exactly the failure the
// whole plan exists to prevent, and nothing failed, so nothing says so.
//
// The probe: a child process takes the lock and holds it, while the parent times how long
// its own WithPublicationLock() call takes to get in. If the lock works, the parent waits
// roughly as long as the child holds it. If it does not, the parent returns immediately -
// which is precisely the interleaving that loses the update.
//
// On SQLite this is expected to report NOT SERIALISED and that is correct rather than a
// failure: SqliteDialect::WithPublicationLock() is a documented no-op, because under
// ADR-0008 SQLite is not a runtime engine and the built-in server that serves a dev boot is
// single-process. Run it against PostgreSQL to see the lock actually hold.
//
// Exit codes: 0 when the engine's documented behaviour is what was observed.
